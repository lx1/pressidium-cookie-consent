### 🐞 Reporting Bugs

> [!WARNING]
> **DO NOT** file public issues for security vulnerabilities!  
> Instead, email us at [security@pressidium.com](mailto:security@pressidium.com).

Before opening a bug report, check the 🗃 [issues](https://github.com/pressidium/pressidium-cookie-consent/issues) tab to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, give it a thumbs up or comment with additional information. If it hasn’t, feel free to open a new issue.

When opening a bug report, please use the [bug report template](https://github.com/pressidium/pressidium-cookie-consent/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). The more information you provide, the easier it will be to reproduce and fix the bug.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem
* Describe the **exact steps to reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible
* Describe the **behaviour you expected** to see and why
* State the **browser(s) and operating system(s)** you’re using
* State the **PHP, WordPress, and plugin versions** you are using
* Provide **screenshots and/or screen recordings** if possible
* Provide **server and/or console logs** if possible

### 🗳️ Requesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! While we will consider all requests, we cannot guarantee your request will be accepted. We love ideas, but we prioritize features that align with the project’s scope. If accepted, we cannot make any commitments regarding the timeline for implementation and release. However, you are welcome to submit a pull request to help!

Before requesting a new feature, check the 🗃 [issues](https://github.com/pressidium/pressidium-cookie-consent/issues) tab to see if the feature has already been requested. If it has, give it a thumbs up or comment with additional details. If it hasn’t, feel free to open a new issue.

When requesting a new feature, please use the [feature request template](https://github.com/pressidium/pressidium-cookie-consent/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). The more information you provide, the easier it will be to understand and implement the feature.

Explain the feature and how it would be useful:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion
* If the feature is related to a problem, **describe the problem** and the feature’s benefits

### 🧑‍💻 Pull Requests

> [!NOTE]
> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

Before submitting a pull request (PR), please make sure your changes are in line with the project’s coding standards. If you’re adding a new feature, it’s a good idea to discuss it in an issue first.

To open a PR, follow these steps:

* **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `master`
* Make your changes and **test them thoroughly**
* If you’ve added code, make sure it’s **well-documented**
* Ensure your code is **compliant with the [project’s coding standards](#-coding-standards)**
* Open a PR and **describe the changes** you’ve made
* If your PR **fixes a bug or resolves an issue, reference it** in the PR description

Once you’ve opened a PR, the project maintainers will review your changes. We may ask questions or request changes that you’ll need to address before we can merge your PR.

Make sure you’re “on the same page” as the project maintainers before you start working on a PR, so that your efforts are not in vain. If you’re unsure about a feature or a bug fix, open an issue and discuss it with the maintainers first.

Once everything is in order, we’ll merge your PR and your changes will be included in the next release 🎉

## 📝 Coding Standards

This project makes use of the following code quality tools:

* [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/) ([custom ruleset](./phpcs.xml))
* [PHPMD](https://github.com/phpmd/phpmd) ([custom ruleset](./phpmd.xml))

Make sure you have these tools installed and configured in your development environment, so you can confirm that your code is compliant with the project’s coding standards.

Once again, these rules are not set in stone. If you believe a rule is too strict or too lenient, feel free to ignore it. Just make sure you have a good reason for doing so.
